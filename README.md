Optimizers.py: Advanced optimization methods including Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD), SGD with momentum and Adam optimizers.

FullyConnected.py: realizes a fully-connected layer with forward propagation, backward propagation and gradients update function.

ReLU.py: realizes a node with ReLU activation function.

SoftMax.py: realizes layer with softmax function for classification problem.

Loss.py: employs cross-entropy loss as loss function.

NeuralNetwork.py: builds a small neural network.

Helpers: Some functions which can help test neural network such as gradient-check and data generalization. 

NeuralNetworkTests.py: test the validity of code.
